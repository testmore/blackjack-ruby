require_relative 'Deck'

# = Description
#
# This class represents the dealer's shoe, which can be 1 or multiple
# card decks.  The cards in the shoe are dealt using deal_card and
# deal_hand which causes the card pile to shrink.  The caller should use the
# can_play method to make sure there is enough cards to deal.
#
# = Synopsis

#   shoe.shuffle
#   shoe.cut_at(123)
#   puts shoe.to_s
