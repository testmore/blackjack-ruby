require_relative 'Card'

# = Description
#
# This class represents a deck of 52 cards; jokers excluded.  It uses the 
# CardSuits and CardSymbols classes to build a deck of Card objects.
# Cards should not be taken from or put into this object; inherit from this
# class if you need to do that.
#
# = Synopsis
#
#   deck = Deck.new
#   deck.shuffle
#   deck.cut(34)
#   puts deck.to_s
#   for card in deck.cards
#     puts card.to_s

class Deck
  # An array of Card objects.

  # Card objects which can be accessed through the cards attribute.

    # Very important to do this to child classes
    # TODO: a regular deck = Deck.new returns the new object, but a child's
    # super returns the suits object above (perhaps because it's the first
    # object defined?).  I need to go figure out this behavior.
    # TODO: is it good practice to always include the line below to be safe?

  # (1 - based) and Card ID with spaces in between each card; 
  # no line break at the end.

    # children are our future, so let's make this method work for them too.
